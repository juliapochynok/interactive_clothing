# Interactive Clothing Project

## Description
A simple clothing supplemented with a frame of intelligent control LED tapes(WS2812B) that change colour of lights and the pattern depending on certain metrics taken by the sensor(in current state - range-finder HC-SR04)

## How it works:
### Getting data to process
*not implemented yet*
### Displaying patterns
Depending on data we get our interactive clothing displays different patterns with different combinations of colours.
*not implemented yet*
