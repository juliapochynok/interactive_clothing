# Interactive Clothing Project

## Description
A simple clothing supplemented with a frame of intelligent control LED tapes(WS2812B) that change colour of lights and the pattern depending on certain metrics taken by the sensor(in current state - range-finder HC-SR04)

## How it works:
### Getting data to process
*not implemented yet*
### Displaying patterns
Depending on data we get our interactive clothing displays different patterns with different combinations of colours.
*not implemented yet*

## Materials that we use

### STM32F4Discovery microcontroller

## Our progress
### Done:
- got acquainted with the principles of diodes operation
- used Motion Detector to illuminate the diode depending on the presence of motion
- worked with one Intelligent control LED (WS2812B)
- got acquainted with the features of the color transfer of the diode
- we work with a rangefinder to illuminate the diode(not WS2812B) depending on the distance at which the object is located.
- we learn how to light up a certain number of LED on the tape 

### Working with:
- We are trying to set a specific color to the Intelligent control LED tape
- We are trying to change LED tape lighting colour depending on distance

### Should be done:
*not implemented yet*
